            <h2><strong>DevU</strong> - Using Game-Enhanced Learning (GEL) to help shape the minds that will shape the web</h2>
            
              <p>After reading the existing literature and the teaching and learning of computer programming and software engineering, most of which has emerged in the last 5-10 years, I discovered a specific need for a better designed curriculum to support beginners in picking up and consistently practicing relevant web and mobile development skills. I conducted over 50 hours of subject interviews and interaction analysis, spent over 400 hours in the field as a student participant observer, and triangulated that data with market research on existing educational programs both local and online.</p>
    
              <p>Adding to my learning research, I also explored the art of game design. The resulting hybrid design paper, fuses the advantages of gaming (i.e.  rapid feedback, engagement, interactivity, and accomplishment) with the science of learning analysis (i.e. cognitive task analysis, pre and post tests, and learner observation). The result is what I call: Game-Enhanced Learning.</p>
    
              <p>I am currently developing the first prototype of DevU. When the prototype is complete, a learner will be guided by a digital mentor, named Cubie, to development the coding skills needed to make their own web sites. Click here to experience a few minutes of the DevU prototype.</p>
