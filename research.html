					<h2><a href="research/LearningInPairProgrammingInteractions.pdf">Investigating Learning in Novice, Pre-Professional Pair Programming Interactions [IRB Approved]</a></h2>
					<p>In this paper, I propose research that aims to help computer programming instructors achieve three outcomes: to better prepare students for future employment as software developers, to diversify both the current academic population and the existing professional population of computer programmers, to improve individual student learning, performance, enrollment, confidence, and enjoyment.</p>

				<li>Narrative Tags In The Classroom: How Co-created Metaphors Facilitate Learning</li>
				<p>Here I describe my findings while participating as a student observer in a three month long web development training program. I found that while attempting to learn web development knowledge, skills, and practices, students and their instructors co-create common verbal references that serve to bundle learned concepts and behaviors, maintain classroom norms, and generate a sense of cooperation and community. These verbal references, referred to in this paper as narrative tags, have their origins in shared stories, metaphors, and analogies. They are either intentionally deployed or naturally emergent, and their use and meaning can evolve over time.</p>

				<li>Using Network Analysis To Predict Learned Strategies For Web Development Tasks</li>
				<p>In this paper, I propose a method for predicting the strategies novice web developers learn and adopt based on their network connections. I begin by describing the specific bounded network I propose to study: a learning organization that trains prospective web developers using instruction, mentorship, and community engagement. I suggest a method of data collection that will allow researchers to observe this network over the course of three months.</p>

				<li>Hold On To Your Holons: A New Theory Of Learning And Expertise</li>
				<p>In this paper, I explore the topic of web page development in an effort to characterize the nature of knowledge and expertise within the domain. I interviewed subjects with varying amounts of experience, asking them to perform two tasks designed to make their knowledge (and how they applied it) observable. I then use the concept of knowledge holons to describe the process by which web developers compress and apply knowledge in order to perform various tasks.</p>

				<li>Visualization Tools To Enhance College Level Introductory Programming Curricula</li>
				<p>Here I examine the high failure rate in introductory higher education computer programming courses and its potential link to the challenges students encounter while transitioning from natural language to computer language. I show how two specific visualization tools (algorithm visualization technology and contextualized media computation) can be used to ease this transition, improve course pass rates, and legitimately prepare students for future employment as professional programmers.</p>

			<a href="research/StartWhereTheyAre.pdf">
				<li>Start Where They Are: An Argument For Development-Centered Algebra Curriculum</li>
				<p>I argue here that algebra teachers who strive to reach Bruner’s ideals and meet existing standards will succeed only by considering the developmental theories of Piaget and Vygotsky in designing and distributing their curricula. I draw on their contributions, recent research analyzing the transition from arithmetic to algebra, and my own experience as a high school algebra teacher. I make a case for algebra teachers to shift their focus to development-centered curriculum, starting with an assessment of each student’s conceptual understanding of arithmetic and their socio-culturally defined relationship with mathematical thinking.</p>
